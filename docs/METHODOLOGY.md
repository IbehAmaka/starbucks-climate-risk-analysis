# Key Assumptions

## Climate Data
- CMIP6 multi-model ensemble (CanESM5, CNRM-CM6-1, MIROC6)
- Temperature units: Kelvin (converted to Celsius)
- Precipitation units: kg/m²/s (converted to mm/year)

## Coffee Optimal Conditions
- Temperature range: 15-24°C
- Optimal temperature: 19.5°C
- Precipitation range: 1,200-2,000mm/year
- Optimal precipitation: 1,600mm/year

## Elevation-Dependent Offsets
- Low elevation (<900m): 9°C daily range
- Mid elevation (900-1,500m): 7-8°C daily range
- High elevation (>1,500m): 5-6°C daily range

## Financial Parameters
- Price elasticity: -0.8 (industry standard)
- Discount rate: 8% (corporate standard)
- Analysis horizon: 2025-2050 (25 years)
- Base coffee price: $3.50/kg
- Revenue per kg: $73.50/kg

## Limitations
- Analysis assumes fixed sourcing regions
- No farmer adaptation scenarios
- Linear stress-to-yield relationships
- No technological breakthroughs assumed

AUTONOMOUS ADAPTATION FACTOR DEFINITION:

The fraction of potential climate-induced yield loss that farmers prevent
through autonomous adaptation - natural farmer response to environmental stress.

MECHANISMS:
- Variety selection: Choosing heat/drought-tolerant cultivars
- Water management: Improving irrigation and water harvesting systems
- Timing adjustment: Shifting planting and harvest dates
- Diversification: Adding complementary crops or income sources
- Knowledge: Accumulated farmer experience responding to stress

EMPIRICAL BASIS (Literature):

1. Mendelsohn, R., et al. (2000). "Climate Change Impacts on African 
   Agriculture." World Bank Technical Paper.
   → Found: ~40% loss reduction through autonomous adaptation

2. Deressa, T. T., et al. (2009). "Determinants of farmers' choice of 
   adaptation methods to climate change in the Nile Basin of Ethiopia."
   → Found: 35-45% loss reduction when farmers respond naturally

3. Seo, S. N., & Mendelsohn, R. (2008). "An Analysis of Crop Choice: 
   Adapting to Climate Change in Latin America."
   → Found: 35-50% loss reduction typical across regions

THIS ANALYSIS:

Base Case (0.4): Middle of empirical range (35-50%)
Conservative (0.2): Lower bound to show pessimistic case
Optimistic (0.6): Upper bound to show best-case adaptation

LIMITATIONS (Portfolio Project):

This is a sensitivity analysis based on published precedent. A real 
Starbucks engagement would:

1. Collect actual technology adoption data by region
   - What % of farms use improved varieties?
   - What % have irrigation systems?
   - What % practice shade-grown coffee?

2. Model region-specific adaptation potential
   - Brazil: High adaptation capacity (developed infrastructure)
   - Colombia: Medium (established systems)
   - Ethiopia: High potential but low current baseline

3. Validate against Starbucks' farmer program historical results
   - How fast do farmers actually adopt new practices?
   - What's the success rate of adaptation programs?
   - What drives adoption (subsidy, ROI, training)?

4. Quantify adaptation costs and ROI
   - Investment: $X to achieve 0.4→0.6 adaptation factor
   - Benefit: Avoided loss of $Y
   - ROI: Y/X = Z times return

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
Real analysis likely shifts adaptation factor to 0.35-0.50 range.
This sensitivity test shows results ROBUST across that range.
Strategic recommendations (diversification, farmer support) 
hold regardless of which assumption is correct.
